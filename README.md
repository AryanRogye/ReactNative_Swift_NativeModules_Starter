## make sure u prebuild then npx expo run:ios
## Before making native swift files add it in ios/NativeModules/ first then open ios.ExpoSwiftBareboneTest.xcworkspace
## click on the folder then add the files you added in NativeModules, <- By doing this Xcode knows to add it idk why lol
## Works but I want a swiftui lifecycle
